  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
#    - family: Manrope
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Manrope-VariableFont_wght.ttf
#  #         style: italic
#    - family: Urbanist
#      fonts:
#        - asset: assets/fonts/Urbanist-VariableFont_wght.ttf
